============

Installation
------------

The easiest way to get started with the .NET SDK is to use the NuGet package. That can be installed from the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio with the command :

```
  Install-Package KeenClient -Version 0.1.3
```

The most up to date code is available in this repo.

```  

Initializing the Library
------------------------

```
  var prjSettings = new ProjectSettingsProvider("YourProjectID", writeKey: "YourWriteKey");
  var keenClient = new KeenClient(prjSettings);
```

Recording Events
----------------

Event data is provided to the client as an object. A simple way to do this is with an anonymous object:

```
  var aPurchase = new
    {
        category = "magical animals",
        username = "hagrid",
        price = 7.13,
        payment_type = "information",
        animal_type = "norwegian ridgeback dragon"
    };
    
  keenClient.AddEvent("purchases", aPurchase);
```

Recording Events Asynchronously
-------------------------------

Sometimes you want to record events in a non-blocking manner.  This is pretty simple:

```
  keenClient.AddEventAsync("purchases", aPurchase);
```

Using Global Properties
-----------------------

Static global properties are added with the KeenClient AddGlobalProperty method:

```
  keenClient.AddGlobalProperty("clienttype", "mobile");
```

Static global properties are added at the root level of all events just before they are sent or cached.

Dynamic global properties are added the same way, but rather than a static object an object supporting IDynamicPropertyValue is added. The class DynamicPropertyValue implements this interface and may be used to provide dynamic properties with a Func<object> delegate:

```
  var dynProp = new DynamicPropertyValue(() => new Random().Next(9999));
  keenClient.AddGlobalProperty("bonusfield", dynProp );
```

The delegate function is executed each time event data is added, but it may also be executed at other times as well.

Full Example
------------

```
  static void Main(string[] args){
      // Set up the client
      var prjSettings = new ProjectSettingsProvider("YourProjectID", writeKey: "YourWriteKey");
      var keenClient = new KeenClient(prjSettings);

      keenClient.AddGlobalProperty("clienttype", "mobile");

      var dynProp = new DynamicPropertyValue(() => new Random().Next(9999));
      keenClient.AddGlobalProperty("bonusfield", dynProp );

      // Build an event object
      var aPurchase = new
      {
          category = "magical animals",
          username = "hagrid",
          price = 7.13,
          payment_type = "information",
          animal_type = "norwegian ridgeback dragon"
      };

      // send the event
      keenClient.AddEvent( "purchases", aPurchase);
  }
```
